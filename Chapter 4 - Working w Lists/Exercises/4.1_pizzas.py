print('\n')

# Store 3 of your favorite pizzas in a list. Use a for loop to print the name of each pizza:
pizzas = ['bacon-pineapple', 'mediterranean', 'chicken-alfredo']
for pizza in pizzas:
    print(pizza)
print('\n')

# Modify your for loop to print a sentence with each pizza name:
for pizza in pizzas:
    print(f"I love {pizza} pizza!")
print('\n')

# Add a line at the end of your(this) program, outside the for loop, stating your love of pizza:
print("Those are my favorites, but I like all the pizzas!")
